Strategy: Stream file line-by-line, grouping edges by (claim_id, status_code) into separate directed graphs. For each graph, use DFS from every node to find simple cycles back to the start node, tracking the longest.

Complexity: O(n) file read, O(V! worst case) cycle detection per graph, but graphs are small in practice.

Memory: Only stores edge data, not raw lines. Scales with unique (claim_id, status_code, source, dest) tuples.

Pros: Simple, correct, handles streaming.
Cons: DFS cycle detection is exponential worst-case.

Future: Add pruning, parallel processing for independent graphs, or Johnson's algorithm for better cycle enumeration.
